# Image-Filtering-in-C
Iâ€™ve developed an image processing program in C that can apply various transformations to images, including grayscale conversion, blurring, reflection, and edge detection. This project showcases my ability to handle complex algorithms, optimize performance, and utilize core C language features like data structures, functions, and modularity.
